## Task

Our (hypothetical) marketing department needs some help in focussing on the most important market segment. Instead of marketing to everyone, they need our help in identifying who our most profitable customers are. Are they married or unmarried, working or retired, premium or budget buyers etc… This will help them position things better.
Also, they need help in identifying the bestselling products.
So, given the transaction data, help us identify the top 3 most profitable products and characteristics of our most loyal customers. Also include your hypothesis of why you think the loyal customers like


### Most profitable customers overall – Older singles/couples
### Most profitable customers(budget) – Older families
### Most profitable customers(mainstream) – Young Singles/couples
### Most profitable customers(premium) – Older singles/couples

Overall greatest profit is generated by mainstream products so its advised that we focus on the young singles/couples.

Top 3 selling product – 

1. 	Dorito Corn Chip supreme 380g, most often bought by – older families
2.	Kettle Mozzarella Basil and Pesto 175g, most often bought by older singles/couples
3.	Kettle Tortilla Chips, honey and Jlpno chili 150g, most often bought by Older singles/couples


Top 3 most profitable products –

1.	Dorito Corn Chips Supreme 380g
2.	Smiths Crinkle Chip Original big bag 380g
3.	Smiths Crinkle Chips Salt and Vinegar 330g

Characteristics of the most loyal customers – 

Older Single/couples and old families – buy the most from the kettle company

mainstream members buy more products in total and also spend more money in total 
The category of people who make the company the most profit are the mainstream consumers, so its smartest to invest in making sure there’s more products and services bought by the mainstream consumers. Plus most of the mainstream consumers are young singles/couples, this category is more prone to impulse buying and also buying more than needed.
